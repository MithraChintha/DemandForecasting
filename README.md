# DemandForecasting
Decision Support System at Fuji food services

# Project Overview
Fuji Food Services delivers food to businesses and corporations in the metropolitan area of
Hartford. Fuji’s business model is based on Tamago‐Ya’s model, a Japanese company that
produces and delivers high‐quality lunch (bento) boxes at a low price of about $5.60 per box
to office workers in the Tokyo metropolitan area.
The idea is that orders for lunchboxes will be received every day from 9 to 10:30 am, and then
delivered by noon. Notice that the lead time for production and delivery of the last order
could be as little as 90 minutes. Hence, all orders should be quickly entered and once they are
compiled, Fuji must promptly decide the best way to deliver the orders, taking into
consideration that its marketing strategy relies on the promise of delivery on time. To cope
with demand, Fuji has divided the Hartford area into eight disjoint regions and setup
distribution centers in each region to prepare and deliver the lunch boxes. These centers are
located at Bloomfield, Farmington, Glastonbury, Hartford, Manchester, Southington, West
Hartford, and Windsor, respectively.
Orders are compiled according to the region where they are placed. Each lunch box contains six
items, most of which are made from organic and natural ingredients. Fuji publishes its menu both on
its website and on a sheet of paper handed out to customers. Typical customers are corporate, which
would buy many lunch boxes, or individuals, who would only buy one box.

Fuji wishes to create a decision support system (DSS) to help with two important aspects in their
daily planning:
# Demand monitoring: 
To better plan for ingredient procurement from suppliers, Fuji wants
to keep track of daily historic demand. Concretely, the system should provide a friendly userinterface
to enter orders into a database to record and aggregate the usage of
different ingredients.
# Demand forecasting:
Since Fuji promises high quality, made of fresh ingredients, lunchboxes, it is
very important to estimate the ingredients required for the next seven days and timely order the
appropriate amounts from the suppliers. Demand is sensitive to weather changes. For example,
they receive more orders on rainy or very cold days since people do not want to go out for lunch.
To forecast demand, Fuji has prepared a data set consisting of the number of boxes ordered per
region/distribution center for the past four months.
